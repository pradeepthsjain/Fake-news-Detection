# Fake News Detection

**Abstract** : 
In an era where misinformation and fake news are rampant, distinguishing genuine news from fabricated content has become crucial. This project presents a web application designed to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, developed with Flask for backend support.  

The system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze textual content, identifying linguistic patterns and semantic inconsistencies often associated with fake news. By pre-processing data through tokenization, stemming, and vectorization, the model is trained on a curated dataset containing both authentic and false news articles.  

Users can input news headlines or full articles into the application, which evaluates and predicts whether the content is real or fake with high accuracy. The intuitive web interface ensures accessibility, allowing users to easily interact with the system.  

This application aims to empower individuals and organizations to make informed decisions by minimizing the spread of misinformation. It also serves as a practical implementation of NLP and Flask, showcasing the potential of artificial intelligence in addressing societal challenges.
